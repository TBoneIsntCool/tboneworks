                        üëã Hey! I'm TBone and I'm a track runner and developer! üèÉ
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm  TBone, a self-taught developer who has been working with Blender for two years and C# Unity for four months. My love for coding and 3D design has been an integral part of my life for a while now, and I feel great satisfaction in combining the two to make unique  and interesting projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey in 3D design started when I was just a kid. I was always fascinated by how animated films were made and how 3D models were brought to life. So, when I discovered Blender, it was like a dream come true for  me. Blender's powerful toolset and user-friendly interface allowed me to dive deeply into 3D modeling, texturing, and animation, and I've been hooked ever since. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past two years, I've been using Blender to make diverse projects ranging from short films, game  assets, 3D modeling  for architectural visualization, and much more. I've  also been experimenting with Blender's powerful physics engine to make realistic simulations. Four months ago, I decided to extend my skillset by delving into game development using C# Unity. The immense potential  of game development intrigued me, and I was excited to learn about C# as a language for Unity. While learning Unity, I discovered  that C# is an incredibly versatile language that can be used to make desktop applications, web applications, and much more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started learning C# by watching tutorials, reading articles, and  practicing coding exercises.  I also joined  online communities to learn from  other developers and participate in various projects. It  wasn't easy, but my determination and passion helped me to remain motivated and continue learning. Now, after four months of work with C# Unity,  I've already  started developing a few simple games. I've learned how to create game  mechanics, implement user interfaces, and optimize game performance. I'm excited to keep learning and develop more complex games that can challenge and entertain players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         One of the things I love about about  working with Blender and C# Unity is the ability to fuse the two to produce dynamic and interactive experiences. By using C# to manipulate the behavior of objects in Blender scenes, I can produce immersive experiences that allow users to interact with 3D models and explore environments in real-time. This experience opened up a whole new universe of possibilities for me, from creating educational applications to designing interactive art installations. I'm excited to keep exploring the  intersection between 3D design and game development  and see where it takes me in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In addition to my technical skills, I also have a strong artistic background. Before discovering Blender and C# Unity, I was already an artist with a passion for creating. I enjoy using my artistic skills to bring my projects to life, from creating intricate textures and lighting setups in Blender to designing user interfaces in C# Unity. I also enjoy collaborating with other artists and designers to create visually stunning and cohesive projects. Combining my artistic and technical skills has been an essential part of my success as a developer, and I'm always looking for new ways to merge the two.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         As a self-taught developer, I understand the importance of constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. To achieve this, I regularly participate in online courses, and read books and articles on programming and game development. I also actively contribute to open-source projects and online communities, both as a way of giving back and as a means of learning from other developers. Learning is a lifelong process, and I'm committed to continually expanding my knowledge and improving my craft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In conclusion, my passion for coding and 3D design has been a driving force in my life for years, and I'm excited to continue exploring these fields as a developer. I believe that by combining my technical and artistic skills, I can create projects that not only look great but also provide meaningful and engaging experiences for users. Whether I'm working on a short film or developing a game, I'm always striving to push the boundaries of what's possible and inspire others to do the same. I look forward to what the future holds for me as a developer and the exciting projects that lie ahead.
